# Welcome to the Yearly Advent of Code

Each participant should at least read the [participant guide](participants_how-to.md), [rules](rules.md) and this [README](README.md) while the host will additionally need to read the [host setup guide](host_setup.md).

## Advent of Code (AOC) description

> "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware. If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to [Shareon Mastodon] it with others, or directly via PayPal or Coinbase. Advent of Code is a registered trademark in the United States." ([Advent of Code / About](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about))

## Repository description

This repository was created to allow multiple participants to compare the actual code, score and compete against each others during the AOC time.

Upon setting up the repository, it will generate a folder for each participant, and a folder for each day. The participants will then be able to add their code and solutions in their corresponding folder.  
Furthermore to allow the participants to compare their score, the repository will help you through the process of setting up and publishing a django server that will allow the participants to see their score and compare it to the other participants. Although this would be possible with the native AOC Leaderboard (see [Advent of Code / Leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard)), the goal of this own webserver is to develop a more user-friendly interface and custom features that would not be possible with the native AOC Leaderboard.

<span style="color:orange">Recommendations for features, graphical improvements, etc. are very welcome and will be considered in future updates.</span>
